  <p>The last trip I took to the South of France with my dad was as memorable as can be. 
  We spent a week there and visited three different small towns while enjoying coffee and looking at the beautiful scenery.
  My favorite part of the trip was visiting the small market in Cassis and doing a boat trip around the landscape.</p>

  <p>My favorite pet names for a cat, dog, and fish are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A cat named Paws</li>
    <li>A dog named Dexter</li>
    <li>A fish named lucky</li>
  </ul>
