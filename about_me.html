  <h1>Julian Baumann</h1>
  <p>The last trip I took to the South of France with my dad was as memorable as can be. 
  We spent a week there and visited three different small towns while enjoying coffee and looking at the beautiful scenery.
  My favorite part of the trip was visiting the small market in Cassis and doing a boat trip around the landscape.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My favorite pet names for a cat, dog, and fish are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A cat named Paws</li>
    <li>A dog named Dexter</li>
    <li>A fish named Lucky</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>My favorite restaurant is in San Diego and it's called <a href="https://www.dukeslajolla.com/" target="_blank">Duke's</a>. Not only is the food great, but what makes it spectacular is how the 
    restaurant balcony overlooks the water and the cliffs of La Jolla. If you go, you should try the Hula Pie!</p>
